# PyGalaga
2 Player Online Galaga using PyGame

David Durkin and Chris Beaufils

In order to run our game, run the server file using 'python galagaServer.py'. In a separate window, run 'python Ship.py host' to initialize the game screen. The second player will join the game by running 'python Ship.py join' and the game will begin for both players. Five enemies will spawn and move around the screen at a random velocity. Each player can control their own ship using the left and right keys, and can view the other player's movements as well. Using the space bar to shoot, the objective is to shoot down each continuing wave of enemies that will respawn once all of the enemies in a level are defeated.
